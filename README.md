## 🚀 Our Brainstorming Journey

1. **Hackathon Tracks**: Started by brainstorming along the SJHacks tracks — Homelessness, Clean up your city, and Public Safety.
3. **Selection**: Chose **Emergency QR Codes** for maximum accessibility and quick impact.
4. **Branding**: Evolved our identity into:
   - **Team Name**: **SJ ResQ**
   - **App Name**: **HelpHub**
5. **Design & Naming**: Brainstormed names, sketched icons, drafted mockups — all guided by user simplicity and trust.
